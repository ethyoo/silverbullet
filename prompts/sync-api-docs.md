The `common/space_lua/stdlib` folder contains implementations of the standard Lua library functions in TypeScript. These APIs should all be documented in a markdown format under `website/API` folder. The markdown files should be named after the Lua module they represent. For example, the `string` module should be documented in `website/API/string.md`.

Ignore the `printf` module, as it is not part of the standard Lua library.

Please compare the APIs implemented in TypeScript and make sure they appear in the API documentation. Add documentation for any missing APIs, follow the same format as the existing documentation.
